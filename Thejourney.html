                <p align="justify ">Our entire life when we shop,we are limited by choices that are there in a store.We are often on the side where we buy our favourite coloured shoes made by
                  someone else but what if we designed it?What if we could involve in the making of a shoe we want to buy?This little thought sprouted to become what we are
                  today,KICKSUP!;)</p>
                  <br>
              <h2 align="justify">Chapter I</h2>
                <p align="justify ">Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think when they buy were our top priorities before we moved further in the building.After weeks of
                  fruitful reasearch we stepped into the user's shoes and look what we plan to do.It's a great joy for the users if they are involed in the making.We are heading into an era of 
                  technology and people prefer online shopping to shopping in an outlet.</p>

              <h2 align="justify">Chapter II</h2>
                <p align="justify ">Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP sprouted,the team manufactured in small scale with two users a month.This experience was 
                  crucial to our brand as this is our first practical experience.Interacting with the users was the best thing ever.The positive reviews and support from people 
                  motivated us to push our limits further.</p>
